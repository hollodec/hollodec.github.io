  ABSTRACT: 'This chapter reflects on Anthony King{\textquoteright}s work as a student
    of liberal democracy, in particular his work on the changing character and quality
    of British and American democracy. King wrote a great deal about these two cases
    and the democratic ideas, institutions and practices associated with each. The
    chapter identifies and engages with three general themes that characterised King{\textquoteright}s
    writings: his general interest in democratic diversity, his scepticism towards
    too much democracy, especially in the form of {\textquoteleft}hyper responsiveness{\textquoteright},
    and his concern with the quality of government and democratic outputs. The author
    argues that King was ultimately a realist when it came to democracy: it was what
    it was and it could be successful in different ways. Largely for that reason,
    democratic government was something that deserved to be described, explained,
    evaluated and above all understood on its own terms and in its different incarnations.'

  ABSTRACT: Anthony King thought and wrote a great deal about British prime ministers
    and political leadership more generally. But in contrast to the way in which single
    papers embodied his contribution to our understanding of {\textquoteleft}government
    overload{\textquoteright}, {\textquoteleft}executive-legislative relations{\textquoteright}
    and {\textquoteleft}career politicians{\textquoteright}, his contribution to our
    understanding of the prime ministership was defined by a body of work. This essay
    explores that body of work and identifies some of the themes that characterised
    it. It then relates King's work to claims about the {\textquoteleft}presidentialisation{\textquoteright}
    of the office, as well as the importance of the expectations surrounding contemporary
    prime ministers. As Britain grapples with the challenge of Brexit, we should all
    take note of his counsel against expecting too much in the way of {\textquoteleft}strong{\textquoteright}
    prime ministerial leadership.

  ABSTRACT: Anthony King, latterly Essex County Council Millennium Professor of British
    Government at the University of Essex, died in January 2017 after a short illness.
    This article pays tribute to his work and reflects on his contribution to both
    the study of British politics and the British study of politics.

  ABSTRACT: Do leaders of {\textquoteleft}challenger{\textquoteright} parties adopt
    a {\textquoteleft}niche{\textquoteright} strategy in national televised debates?
    This article answers this question by analysing the content of the two multiparty
    televised leaders{\textquoteright} debates that took place ahead of the 2015 British
    general election. Using computer-aided text analysis (CATA), it provides reliable
    and valid measures of what the leaders said in both debates and develops our theoretical
    understanding of how challenger-party leaders make their pitches. It finds that
    the UK Independence Party (UKIP), Green Party, Scottish National Party (SNP) and
    Plaid Cymru leaders all demonstrated a degree of {\textquoteleft}nicheness{\textquoteright}
    in their contributions in comparison with the Conservative, Liberal Democrat and
    Labour leaders. It also finds that the challenger-party leaders placed a greater
    emphasis on their core concerns. Nevertheless, the debates covered much policy
    ground. Their structure obliged all party leaders to talk about a broad range
    of issues.

  ABSTRACT: This note analyses the formation of Theresa May{\textquoteright}s first
    Cabinet. It locates her appointments against the backdrop of the Brexit referendum
    and compares them to those of other Prime Ministers who took office during the
    lifetime of a parliament. The scale of May{\textquoteright}s reconstruction marks
    her out as one of the readier {\textquoteleft}butchers{\textquoteright} of Downing
    Street. It demonstrated her acceptance of the Brexit referendum result, signalled
    a clear break with Cameron and served to consolidate her power base. It also demonstrated
    the huge potential leeway enjoyed by new Prime Ministers. However, while wholesale
    ministerial butchery can be empowering, demonstrations of ruthlessness are no
    guarantee for future power.

  ABSTRACT: This article assesses the roles of anxiety and anger in shaping people{\textquoteright}s
    perceptions of politicians{\textquoteright} integrity. Drawing on recent work
    on the role of affect in shaping political judgement, the article develops a theoretical
    model of the anticipated role of anger and anxiety in structuring reactions to
    allegations of political misconduct. The model is tested on a unique data set
    that includes results of an experiment fielded as part of a survey carried out
    in January 2013 among a representative sample of the French adult population.
    The analysis finds that those in whom politically dubious actions generate anxiety
    are more sensitive to contextual details than other respondents, although the
    role of anger in modulating ethical judgements is less clear-cut, dampening attention
    to information about negatively assessed behaviour but enhancing attention to
    information about behaviour that is assessed more positively.

  ABSTRACT: 'Many citizens across the liberal democratic world are highly critical
    of their elected representatives{\textquoteright} conduct. Drawing on original
    survey data from Britain, France and Germany, this paper offers a unique insight
    into prevailing attitudes across Europe{\textquoteright}s three largest democracies.
    It finds remarkable consistencies in the ethical priorities of British, French
    and German citizens: although there is some individual-level variation, respondents
    in all three countries overwhelmingly prioritise having honest representatives.
    It also finds differences in the types of behaviour that cause most concern in
    each country. The paper then examines how individuals{\textquoteright} preferences
    shape their concerns about prevailing standards. The findings are consistent with
    the idea that citizens{\textquoteright} predispositions have an {\textquoteleft}anchoring{\textquoteright}
    effect on perceptions of political integrity. Finally, the paper considers whether
    established democracies are susceptible to an {\textquoteleft}expectations gap{\textquoteright}
    between citizens{\textquoteright} expectations of conduct and what {\textquoteleft}normal{\textquoteright}
    politics can realistically deliver.'

  ABSTRACT: Does gender matter in the way in which we {\textquoteleft}perform{\textquoteright}
    academia? Drawing on the results of a practitioner survey, we argue that gender
    does matter, culturally and structurally, and can be institutionalised so that
    women are disadvantaged. This is not to deny women{\textquoteright}s agency or
    the advances that they have made. Rather, we highlight the inequality of the playing
    field in which the academic endeavour is conducted. Uniquely, we ask UK political
    scientists about their perceptions of the impact of gender in their working lives
    and explore their views on recommendations for change.

  ABSTRACT: This article analyses the content of the 2015 British General Election
    manifestos using manually derived Manifesto Project estimates and computer-assisted
    text analysis (CATA). It analyses the parties{\textquoteright} policy emphases,
    investigates their ideological positioning and movement, and further compares
    their policy agendas with voters{\textquoteright} concerns. It finds the three
    main parties moved slightly leftwards but continued to agree on the broad thrust
    of economic policy. It also finds that, while the economy dominated the manifestos,
    there was considerable differentiation in respect of other issues. Finally, the
    parties appeared to downplay the issue of immigration despite its importance to
    the public.

  ABSTRACT: This paper reports the results from a deliberative event for young people
    (16- to 18-yearolds), inspired by the UK Political and Constitutional Reform Committee{\textquoteright}s
    2014 report, A new Magna Carta?, which asked whether Britain should adopt a written
    constitution. Deliberative events are a potential vehicle for engaging young people
    with potentially distant political issues. We found that participating in deliberative
    activities increased young people{\textquoteright}s knowledge about the constitutional
    options set out in A new Magna Carta?, and it also crystallised opinions about
    Britain{\textquoteright}s constitution. Our research was clear in finding little
    support among our participants for a written constitution, and it was also clear
    that deliberation, if anything, entrenched support for the status quo. We further
    suggest that parliamentarians and policy makers might use deliberative-polling
    events more systematically and routinely to consult and empower young people on
    issues that affect them directly.

  ABSTRACT: The presence of shared interests between politicians and citizens is central
    to many accounts of political representation, yet there has been little empirical
    research into how citizens perceive these interests and whether they think a {\textquoteleft}communion
    of interests{\textquoteright} exists between them and their elected representatives.
    Using new survey data, this paper explores the extent to which Britons think their
    Members of Parliament share the same everyday experiences as they do. It further
    explores the relationship between these perceptions and indicators of specific
    and diffuse political support. We show that British citizens generally say that
    politicians are less affected by social and economic conditions and less reliant
    on public services than they are. The size of this perceived {\textquoteleft}discommunion{\textquoteright}
    affects voting behaviour and satisfaction with democracy.

  ABSTRACT: The three televised leaders{\textquoteright} debates dominated the 2010
    general election campaign. The House of Lords Communications Committee report
    on Broadcast General Election Debates is the product of a welcome but belated
    public inquiry into their organisation and conduct. The report is supportive of
    the view that {\textquoteleft}broadcast general election debates should take place
    during future campaigns{\textquoteright} and makes a number of cautious recommendations
    to the broadcasters. At the time of writing it was unclear whether the format
    proposed by the broadcasters for 2015 would be an improvement on that for 2010—or
    even if there would be any debates at all.

  ABSTRACT: 'Political theorists have developed well-defined normative understandings
    of what constitutes ethical political conduct. Based on democratic theory as well
    as the demands of practical politics, these understandings prescribe certain types
    of behaviour and proscribe other types. However, it is unclear to what extent
    this normative framework has resonance for ordinary citizens. This article demonstrates
    that attention to politics tends to increase the resonance of this normative framework.
    The analysis identifies three norms about the holding of public office that are
    expected to structure citizens'' ethical judgments: the avoidance of conflicts
    of interest; conformity with the law or institutional rules; and the maximisation
    of the public good. The article assesses the importance of these norms in structuring
    judgments by means of an experiment embedded in a population survey conducted
    in Great Britain. The analysis finds that informational cues pertaining to conflict-of-interest
    avoidance only condition responses among the attentive, while information pertaining
    to law conformity has far wider resonance. This finding has implications for approaches
    to political ethics focusing on normative considerations that appear to have low
    salience for much of the general public.'

  ABSTRACT: This article reports the results of a recent survey of British Members
    of Parliament (N = 158) to explore parliamentary evaluations of post-war British
    Prime Ministers. The survey was fielded in 2013 as a part of a collaborative research
    project undertaken by undergraduate students. It finds that MPs in general rated
    Margaret Thatcher as the most successful post-war Prime Minister, with Clement
    Attlee a close runner-up. It also finds that MPs prioritised the implementation
    of party policy above merely winning elections, and that MPs thought successful
    Prime Ministers need to be decisive, principled and intelligent.

  ABSTRACT: Over the last two decades, the combined effect of multiple crises and
    low Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) ceilings has led to the emergence of
    a {\textquoteleft}galaxy{\textquoteright} of EU funds and instruments with variable
    participation of Member States and a diverse range of decision-making and accountability
    procedures. This study analyses the impacts on the EU governance and the ability
    of the European Parliament to fulfil its duties and considers that reforms are
    needed to ensure the EU budget and financial rules reflect the realities the EU
    faces.

  ABSTRACT: Reforming the EU budget so that it is more responsive to changing collective
    needs such as responding to pandemics or energy security while still securing
    minimum levels of solidarity to those sectors most in need depends on changing
    the means of financing the budget in the first place. This chapter evaluates the
    ingredients of a package to achieve such a reform. It does so by analysing what
    we know already about package deals in the EU in which the major actors are able
    to gain more than they lose. Next, it deconstructs the case for countries to use
    national net balances in calculating budgetary costs and benefits given that flows
    of funds at the EU level do not correspond to their distribution by country. High
    contribution burdens can be addressed by compensating for gross rather than net
    contributions, while new forms of revenue would avoid increasing the tax burden
    to finance the post-Covid-19 recovery plan and could deliver policy objectives
    in relation to combating challenges like climate change and transnational tax
    avoidance.

  ABSTRACT: 'We describe the electoral history of one of Europe{\textquoteright}s
    most successful party families over the past 100 years in 31 countries. With a
    unique and newly collected dataset of national election results, and a large number
    of economic and social variables measured for each country-election observation,
    we find that two main factors drive the electoral performance of social democratic
    parties: public sector spending, and the size of the manufacturing sector. Our
    findings suggest that most of the fall in support for social democratic parties
    in recent years is correlated with a decline in the number of industrial workers
    as well as a reduction in the propensity of social democratic parties{\textquoteright}
    core supporters (industrial workers and public sector employees) to vote for them.'

  ABSTRACT: A net budgetary balance is a highly misleading indicator of the benefits
    from EU spending and EU membership.Budgetary decisions taken on the basis of this
    indicator result in poor policies as they are biased towards programmes with monetary
    backflows into Member States. This {\textquoteleft}juste retour{\textquoteright}
    mentality is a major obstacle to achieving more European added value through the
    EU budget. The deeper underlying cause of this misleading and detrimental net
    balance preoccupation is the high salience and political appeal of backflow policies,
    with their easily identifiable national and regional beneficiaries. Policies whose
    European benefits are more dispersed and do not entail payments into Member States
    do receive less voter and policy support. This briefing sketches and discusses
    the following options that might correct this detrimental bias:−a discontinuation
    of the official reporting of net operating balances;−augmented indicators of national
    benefit;−differentiated communication campaigns;−higher budgetary flexibility
    to shift money between budget lines;−institutional reforms (e.g. transnational
    party lists for the European Parliament) or a limit to national veto power on
    the budget;−new own resources (e.g. genuine EU taxes);−a {\textquoteleft}generalised
    correction mechanism{\textquoteright} based on predefined net balances;−differentiated
    co-financing rates.This briefing concludes that despite each suggestion{\textquoteright}s
    specific weakness, a combination of measures could alleviate the damaging fixation
    with {\textquoteleft}budgetary juste retour{\textquoteright}, which is a major
    obstacle for the EU to reach its ambitious European objectives.

  ABSTRACT: Every time a new multiannual financial framework (MFF) is negotiated,
    there is a call for the EU to invest in new policies that provide added-value.
    What would this mean? Firstly, that EU investment is cost effective and that it
    is cheaper to run a single EU expenditure policy even in a policy such as agriculture
    than as 27 or 28 different national expenditure polices. Secondly, that there
    are cross-border benefits, efficiently linking areas of opportunity between the
    Member States. Erasmus+, Horizon 2020, or the Connecting Europe Framework are
    examples of this. Thirdly, it is the ability to afford expensive investment in
    the collective good that any one Member State alone would not be able to afford.
    Examples include Galileo and the nuclear fusion ITER programme. These three types
    of added-value are the basis for the case of reform of the budget. They always
    face challenges from the Member States concerned either to maximise their economic
    benefit, or to minimise the cost for their Treasuries. Others simply call for
    a lower budget, even if most of them recognise the collective benefits of added-value.
    Moreover, some Member States in the face of expenditure reductions, move to salvage
    their benefits in agricultural or cohesion expenditure. The predictable results
    in negotiating the MFFs in 2006 and 2013 were somewhat smaller budgets. These
    contained less of an increase in added-value expenditure than originally proposed,
    and smaller reductions than anticipated for agricultural and cohesion expenditure,
    against a backdrop of net balance or juste retour calculations by Member States.
    The question is how to break this logjam. In 2013, the Parliament accepted a package
    deal of expenditure reductions in exchange for significantly more flexibility
    in the budget, a full scale review of the MFF in 2016-17 and the establishment
    of a High Level Group on Own Resources to investigate new sources of finance for
    the budget (Benedetto 2019). The flexibility and the mid-term review may have
    allowed for a larger real terms budget to have taken effect despite the reduction
    in commitments and payments in the official figures. In turn, the paper will focus
    on the European Commission{\textquoteright}s proposal of 2018 for the new MFF,
    the challenge of net balances, funds and instruments outside the EU budget, and
    possible packages for reform.

  ABSTRACT: 'Embedded consensus has characterised the behaviour of the European Parliament
    since its foundation in the 1950s. This research tests the path dependence of
    consensus during the period of 1994 to 2002, in the light of the changing institutional
    powers of the Parliament. It challenges existing theory and empirical evidence
    drawn mainly from roll call votes that has concluded that the European Parliament
    has become more competitive internally in response to increased institutional
    powers. There are three causal factors that reinforce consensus: the need to reconcile
    national and ideological divisions within a multinational political system; the
    pull of external institutional factors such as institutional change or the separation
    of powers; and internal incentives for collusion between political actors influenced
    by the need to accommodate the interests of the national elites present at the
    level of the European Union. Switzerland, a multiple cleavage system of decentralised
    federalism that includes consociational characteristics and a separation of powers,
    provides a comparative reference point for institutionalised consensus. The hypotheses
    of institutionalised consensus are tested empirically in four ways: 1) by roll
    call votes between 1994 and 2001, focusing on procedure, policy area, and the
    cut-off point of the 1999 elections; 2) competition and consensus in the distribution
    of policy-related office in the Parliament; 3) by Parliament{\textquoteright}s
    use of its powers of appointment and censure over other institutions; and 4) by
    the internal consensus on the preparation of Parliament{\textquoteright}s bids
    for greater powers when the European Union Treaties are reformed. In adapting
    the theory of path dependence to a multinational legislature, the methodology
    presented in this thesis can be applied in furthering the understanding of other
    comparable institutions.'

  ABSTRACT: The Juncker Commission set very ambitious goals upon its election in 2014.
    This chapter will try to assess to what extent it was successful in achieving
    them, with a particular focus on its investment policy and budget matters. The
    assessment will also take into account that the Commission was faced with unexpected
    crises, namely Brexit and the so-called refugee and migration crisis, which put
    extra pressure on it. Moreover, the assessment will consider that the Commission
    was confronted with a lack of consensus at European level on many key policy areas,
    which made the achievement of an agreement even more diffi cult.

  ABSTRACT: 'The budget of the European Union has three pillars: its expenditure,
    its financing and its audit. This briefing looks at the origins of the budget,
    its development through multiannual planning and annual budgeting. It does so
    amid the European Parliament{\textquoteright}s changing powers over the budget,
    and the evolution of its financing and of the audit process. Since the very first
    European Community in 1952, there has been a tension over budgeting among the
    European institutions and the Member States, and a close link between reforms
    to expenditure and those to the financing.'

  ABSTRACT: 'After the Lisbon Treaty came into effect, the European Parliament has
    seen its powers over the negotiations of the European Union{\textquoteright}s
    annual budget reduced. This article shows that, despite initial setbacks and a
    position of relative weakness in the budgetary negotiations, the Parliament can
    extract, through threat of veto, significant concessions in the three pillars
    of the budget: annual expenditure; long-term expenditure; and the revenue side.
    Through process tracing and interviews with key actors, the article evaluates
    the Parliament{\textquoteright}s successes and failures in negotiating the 2013
    budget package and the circumstances under which the Parliament can maximise its
    limited power.'

  ABSTRACT: Since the entry into force of the Financial Perspectives of 2007-2013
    one decade ago, the EU{\textquoteright}s budget has undergone significant change.
    In 2009, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) agreed at
    Lisbon came into effect. This significantly modified the powers of the European
    Union{\textquoteright}s institutions. The eruption of the global financial crisis
    in 2008, followed by the crisis particular to the euro area, led to pressure for
    austerity in the EU{\textquoteright}s Member States and put pressure on the EU{\textquoteright}s
    budget itself. This briefing provides a summary of these developments.

  ABSTRACT: This in-depth analysis introduces the challenges that have been faced
    in delivering a discharge of the Council{\textquoteright}s budget over the last
    decade, with particular regard to the Council{\textquoteright}s executive activities.
    It analyses the institutional and legal constraints, and it makes a number of
    recommendations for how to achieve more accountability regarding the Council{\textquoteright}s
    budget and executive expenditure without resorting to treaty reform.

  ABSTRACT: Using process tracing, this paper charts the history of the changes in
    the EU{\textquoteright}s revenue since 1970, including package deals and the unforeseen
    consequences of change, comparing the positions of the Council to those of the
    European Commission and European Parliament. Those revenue decisions allowed European
    integration to proceed though without a fully autonomous budget as Member States
    became more careful to calculate their net benefits or costs in relation to the
    budget. In December 2013, the European Union{\textquoteright}s institutions established
    a High Level Group to recommend changes to the revenue base of the EU{\textquoteright}s
    budget. This reported in January 2017, proposing to resolve the effect of sub-optimal
    revenue and budget decisions made by the European Union over many years, to reduce
    direct national contributions, to minimise the risk of unforeseen consequences,
    and to combine revenue flows with steering effects to discourage certain forms
    of economic behaviour in line with the wider policy agenda of the European Union.

  ABSTRACT: At the close of 2010 an immediate effect of the rule changes to the European
    Union{\textquoteright}s budgetary powers brought in by the Lisbon Treaty was a
    non-agreement of the annual budget for 2011, which was repeated for the budgets
    of 2013 and 2015. Interviews and documents show that the European Parliament lost
    and the Council won in determining spending outcomes for 2011 and immediate payments
    for the subsequent years; whether this also resulted in lower budgets overall
    is ambiguous. When spending increased, this was in line with the will of the Council.
    The most significant variable was the change in the rules, which shifted the location
    of the default budget or reversion point to Council{\textquoteright}s advantage
    if there were no agreement.

  ABSTRACT: This paper shows what the effect of the Lisbon Treaty has been on the
    amounts of money allocated to different areas of spending in the EU budget. How
    has the Treaty changed the powers of the European Parliament and of the national
    governments of the EU to implement their preferences in terms of who gets what
    from the budget pie? In the annual negotiations on the EU budget, spending – whether
    earmarked for redistribution or for public goods like research and development
    – has become more constrained. The powers of the European Parliament are reduced,
    the budget becomes more inflexible and the rules of the Lisbon Treaty have reduced
    the amounts available to spend compared to what would have occurred under the
    previous rules.

  ABSTRACT: This article examines the changes of the Lisbon Treaty to the rules on
    agreeing the EU{\textquoteright}s annual budget and multiannual financial framework.
    The comparative budgets literature as well as theories of agenda-setting, veto
    players and empowerment of the European Parliament inform the analysis of how
    the EU{\textquoteright}s budgetary powers changed and the likely outcomes on spending.
    Overall, the powers of the European Parliament are reduced, the budget becomes
    more inflexible and, most significantly, the rules of the Lisbon Treaty have the
    effect of reducing the amounts available to spend. Although the Lisbon Treaty
    grants the European Parliament greater influence over ordinary EU legislation,
    national governments seem to have used the same treaty to send the Parliament{\textquoteright}s
    budgetary powers in the opposite direction and to curtail EU expenditure.

  ABSTRACT: What explains the explosive growth of school vouchers in the last two
    decades? In America{\textquoteright}s Voucher Politics, Ursula Hackett shows that
    the roots of the voucher movement lie in America{\textquoteright}s foundational
    struggles over religion, race, and the role of government versus the private sector.
    Drawing upon original datasets, archival materials, and more than one hundred
    candid interviews with policymakers across the United States, Hackett shows that
    policymakers and political advocates use strategic policy design and rhetoric
    to hide the role of the state when their policy goals become legally controversial.
    Patiently, tactically, iteratively – over more than sixty years of voucher litigation
    – white supremacists, accommodationists, and individualists have honed this strategy
    of attenuated governance in court. By learning from previous mistakes and anticipating
    downstream effects, policymakers can avoid painful defeats, gain a secure legal
    footing, and entrench their policy commitments in spite of the surging power of
    rivals.

  ABSTRACT: Indirect or delegated governance engages private organizations, tax expenditures
    or service users to deliver programs that would otherwise be provided by the government
    direct. This paper explains the rise of indirect governance in terms of policymakers{\textquoteright}
    strategic use of {\textquoteleft}attenuation{\textquoteright} to avoid political
    and legal challenge. Attenuation is the process by which a government obscures
    its role in promoting a particular policy goal, through communication strategies
    (attenuating rhetoric), or by utilizing private third parties and the tax system
    to deliver a benefit (attenuated design). Deploying policymaker interviews and
    an original historical database of private school choice programs and their legal
    and political defense, 1953-2017, I argue that pursuing both attenuated design
    and attenuating rhetoric at once helps policies pass and spread by publicly dissociating
    the government from legally contentious policy outputs.

  ABSTRACT: 'Historically vouchers, which provide a sum of money to parents for private
    education, were tools of racist oppression; but in recent decades some advocates
    claim them as {\textquoteleft}the civil rights issue of our time.{\textquoteright}
    This paper brings an analytic-historical perspective rooted in racial orders to
    understand how education vouchers have been reincarnated and reinvented since
    the Jim Crow era. Combining original primary research with statistical analysis
    we identify multiple concurrent and consecutive transformations in voucher politics
    in three arenas of racial policy alliance contestation: expansion of color-blind
    policy designs, growing legal and political support from a conservative alliance,
    and a smorgasbord of voucher rationales rooted in color-blind framing. This approach
    demonstrates that education vouchers have never been racially neutral but served
    key roles in respect to prevailing racial hierarchies and contests.'

  ABSTRACT: In this paper, I apply Mettler's concept of the “submerged state” to aid
    for children at private schools in the United States, including education vouchers,
    in-kind aid, and property tax exemptions. All aid policies are “submerged” in
    that they help private organizations take on state functions but some are more
    submerged than others. Theoretically, this paper distinguishes between subcategories
    of submergence. Using policy data from 50 states and an original database of court
    challenges between 1912 and 2015, I employ probit regression with sample selection
    to evaluate the effect of submergence on successful court challenge. I find that
    more submerged policies are less likely to be successfully challenged than less
    submerged policies. Submerged policy design enables supporters to avoid legal
    as well as political challenge.

  ABSTRACT: '“The Great Society” denotes, variously: a slogan or shorthand, a utopia,
    a means, an end, an era, and a set of normative claims. This article tracks the
    changing meanings of The Great Society in order to clarify and formalize scholarly
    claims about the Johnson administration. Employing Edward Sapir''s conception
    of “condensation symbols” and Keith Donnellan''s distinction between “referential”
    and “attributive” descriptions, I create a typology of six Great Societies and
    trace the origins and deployment of these six meanings through qualitative textual
    analysis of presidential speeches, newspapers, and scholarly writings. Attributive
    uses of the term gave way to referential uses in the late 1960s, as radical movements
    and practical implementation problems eclipsed utopian visions of a great society.
    The analysis illuminates Johnson''s character and contributes to the literature
    on the rhetorical presidency by demonstrating the importance of context, ambiguity,
    and the attribution of descriptive content to political slogans.'

  ABSTRACT: In America's culture wars denominations increasingly ally with one another
    despite differences in theology, church organization, and membership. But these
    developments are not reflected in America's private K-12 school system or in patterns
    of public aid for children who attend them where divisions between religious traditions
    remain stark. I demonstrate, by means of an analysis of critical junctures in
    American political development supported by statistical analysis, that Catholics
    who desire a religious education for their children have historically tended to
    exit for the parochial sector while Evangelicals having similar desires lobbied
    for reform of the public school system. These differential group responses stem
    from differing conceptions of identity and belonging, theological understanding,
    and institutional structure. In American education policy, differences between
    religious groups are surprisingly tenacious.

  ABSTRACT: This symposium examines the politics of religious alliances. While the
    literature on religion and politics generally focuses on differences across individuals,
    congregations, denominations, or traditions, these articles instead ask how, when,
    and why religious groups do — and do not — form alliances with other organizations,
    both religious and secular. Specifically, this collection of original research
    examines the formation of multi-denominational coalitions among party activists,
    litigants, and religious leaders. These varied articles arose from a workshop
    at Oxford University in March 2015, an event hosted and funded by the Rothermere
    American Institute. The collection explores the impact of religious coalitional
    activity upon political attitudes, decision-making, and public policy development.
    It is wide-ranging, extending our understanding of religious coalitional activity
    beyond the United States and dealing with topics of vital current significance,
    including the swiftly changing landscape of school voucher and tax credit expansion,
    same-sex marriage, healthcare, and abortion advocacy.

  ABSTRACT: 'Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), a technique by which the tools
    of Boolean algebra are applied to equifinal causal conditions, is gaining popularity
    amongst scholars. This paper draws upon a distinction largely overlooked by the
    QCA literature: the difference between inclusive- and exclusive-or (OR and XOR).
    I argue that XOR should be included amongst the tools of QCA, explain why XOR
    is more easily applied to crisp- than fuzzy-set QCA, and provide two original
    techniques for applying XOR to fuzzy sets: mechanical and calibrated. With the
    calibrated technique, the application of the exclusive-or is related to substantive
    knowledge of the cases with two threshold values: (1) how large two fuzzy set
    values need to be in order to violate a prior commitment or overshoot a target
    outcome, and (2) how similar two values need to be in order to violate the rule:
    {\textquoteleft}A or B, but not both{\textquoteright}. This paper improves the
    capacity of QCA expressions to mirror natural language closely, formalize conversational
    implicature, and deal with mutually exclusive clusters of sufficiency conditions.
    It includes a helpful step-by-step guide for QCA practitioners.'

  ABSTRACT: 'The application of Boolean logic using qualitative comparative analysis
    (QCA) is becoming more frequent in political science but is still in its relative
    infancy. Boolean {\textquoteleft}AND{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}OR{\textquoteright}
    are used to express and simplify combinations of necessary and sufficient conditions.
    This paper draws out a distinction overlooked by the QCA literature: the difference
    between inclusive- and exclusive-or (OR and XOR). It demonstrates that many scholars
    who have used the Boolean OR in fact mean XOR, discusses the implications of this
    confusion, and explains the applications of XOR to QCA. Although XOR can be expressed
    in terms of OR and AND, explicit use of XOR has several advantages: it mirrors
    natural language closely, extends our understanding of equifinality and deals
    with mutually exclusive clusters of sufficiency conditions. XOR deserves explicit
    treatment within QCA because it emphasizes precisely the values that make QCA
    attractive to political scientists: contextualization, confounding variables,
    and multiple and conjunctural causation.'

  ABSTRACT: In the current polarized political climate there is heightened attention
    paid to the American state constitutional provisions known as “Blaine Amendments”
    or “No-Aid Provisions” that were passed between 1835 and 1959 to prohibit public
    aid to religious schools. Judgments about No-Aid Provisions have largely been
    made by scholars on an ad hoc basis using narrative-based historical accounts,
    emotive language and without clear classificatory criteria. Using content analysis
    this article constructs the first quantitative scale of No-Aid Provision strength
    and subjects it to statistical treatment to explain why some prohibitions are
    much stronger than others. It finds that larger Catholic populations, Republican
    dominance, and Federal Enabling Acts make No-Aid language more strident. In so
    doing this article adjudicates between competing explanations for No-Aid Provision
    strength in a way that illuminates the interaction of politics, religion and education
    in America.

  ABSTRACT: I challenge Strong{\textquoteright}s (2022) findings that student employment
    is not related to attendance. I argue that the original analysis is guilty of
    controlling for a post-treatment variable. As a result, the coefficients in the
    regression model do not show how employment causes changes in attendance. I show
    that employment likely has a negative effect on attendance even given severe confounding.
    Academics should, if asked, tell students that their attendance will likely suffer
    the more paid work they do.

  ABSTRACT: Polarization is a key characteristic of party systems, but scholars disagree
    about how polarization relates to the number of parties in a system. Different
    authors find positive, negative, or null relationships. I claim that when polarization
    is measured using the weighted standard deviation of standardized party positions,
    seat-level polarization is equal to (NS - 1) / (1/√2 + NS - 1), where NS is theeffective
    number of seat-winning parties. This relationship is what one would expect if
    parties were drawn randomly from a super-population with an effective sample size
    somewhere between the effective and raw number of parties. I test this claim using
    multiple datasets which report party positions and seat shares, before extending
    my analysis to consider vote-level polarization, the range of positions, and polarization
    in presidential and parliamentary regimes. My work extends the Taageperaan research
    agenda of building interlocking networks of equations relating key quantities
    of electoral and party systems.

  ABSTRACT: 'For incumbents to be accountable for issue stances, voters must sanction
    incumbents whose positions are {"}out-of-step{"}. We test the electoral accountability
    of British legislators for their stance on Brexit. We find very limited issue
    accountability: individuals who disagreed with their representative''s Brexit
    stance were three percentage points less likely to vote for them. Aggregate consequences
    of these individual effects are limited: a one standard deviation increase in
    the proportion of constituents agreeing with their incumbent''s Brexit stance
    is associated with an increase of 0.56 percentage points in incumbent vote share.
    These effects are ~1.5 times larger when the main challenger has a different Brexit
    stance to the incumbent. A follow-up survey of Members of Parliament (MPs) shows
    that MPs'' estimates of the effects of congruence are similar in magnitude. Our
    findings suggest that issue accountability is conditional and limited in magnitude
    even for highly salient issues such as Brexit.'

  ABSTRACT: This article provides an overview of multilevel regression and post-stratification
    (MRP). It reviews the stages in estimating opinion for small areas, identifies
    circumstances in which MRP can go wrong, or go right, and provides a worked example
    for the UK using publicly available data sources and a previously published post-stratification
    frame.

  ABSTRACT: Measuring how much citizens care about different policy issues is critical
    for political scientists, yet existing measurement approaches have significant
    limitations. We provide a new survey-experimental, choice-based approach for measuring
    the importance voters attach to different positional issues, including issues
    not currently contested by political elites. We combine information from (i) direct
    questions eliciting respondents{\textquoteright} positions on different issues
    with (ii) a conjoint experiment asking respondents to trade-off departures from
    their preferred positions on those issues. Applying this method to study the relative
    importance of 34 issues in the UK, we show that British voters attach significant
    importance to issues like the death penalty which are not presently the subject
    of political debate and attach more importance to those issues associated with
    social liberal-conservative rather than economic left-right divisions.

  ABSTRACT: We propose a method for decomposing variation in the issue preferences
    that US citizens express on surveys into three sources of variability that correspond
    to major threads in public opinion research. We find that, averaging across a
    set of high profile US political issues, a single ideological dimension accounts
    for about 1/7 of opinion variation, individuals' idiosyncratic preferences account
    for about 3/7, and response instability for the remaining 3/7. These shares vary
    substantially across issue types and the average share attributable to ideology
    doubles when a second ideological dimension is permitted. We also find that (unidimensional)
    ideology accounts for almost twice as much response variation (and response instability
    is substantially lower) among respondents with high, rather than low, political
    knowledge. Our estimation strategy is based on an ordinal probit model with random
    effects, and is applicable to other data sets that include repeated measurements
    of ordinal issue position data.

  ABSTRACT: In this paper, we investigate patterns of team formation amongst barristers
    who appeared before the UK Supreme Court between October 2009 and August 2015.
    We show that there is evidence of considerable gender homophily in the formation
    of teams of barristers appearing before the UK Supreme Court. Same-sex teams of
    barristers are over-represented compared to the number we would expect if barristers
    paired up randomly. We also show that this gender homophily remains when we allow
    for the possibility that barristers pair up randomly within their chambers, or
    within their area of law. As such, the formation of teams of barristers in the
    Supreme Court is governed by practices and preferences which make same-sex legal
    teams more likely than they would be if team formation simply involved a gender-blind
    draw from a pool of lawyers. Barristers appearing before the Supreme Court prefer,
    for whatever reason, to work with other barristers of the same sex. We set out
    reasons why homophily in team formation is undesirable and discuss the routes
    through which different remedies might operate.

  ABSTRACT: Strategic voting is thought to underpin Duverger{\textquoteright}s Law
    and lead to two-party outcomes in single-member district plurality (SMDP) systems.
    We examine the extent of strategic voting in the world{\textquoteright}s most
    populous democracy, India, where frequent exceptions to Duverger{\textquoteright}s
    Law have long puzzled political scientists. Using an original voter survey from
    the 2017 Uttar Pradesh state election, we find extremely low rates of strategic
    voting. Why? We show that the overwhelming majority of respondents believe that
    their preferred party is likely to win in their constituency. For most voters,
    their partisan preferences overwhelmingly predict their beliefs about which party
    will win in their constituency. Their election forecasts correspond to objective
    electoral outcomes only with respect to parties that they like less.

  ABSTRACT: Although populist leaders often employ an anti-elite discourse which presents
    the elite as unable or unwilling to represent ordinary citizens, we know very
    little about who elites actually think should be represented, or how this differs,
    if at, all from what ordinary citizens want. In this article we find that there
    is a considerable difference between the groups that voters want to see represented
    in parliament and those which political elites want to see represented. In particular,
    we find that political elites tend to hold far more {\textquoteleft}cosmopolitan{\textquoteright}
    preferences than ordinary voters, and prioritize the representation of greater
    diversity in parliament based on the groups politicised by the new social movements
    and identity politics of the 60s and 70s, such as women, ethnic minorities, LGBT
    and the disabled. By contrast, voters more often hold nativist preferences than
    political elites and more often prioritize the representation of groups such as
    the working class, and white local people. Moreover, British voters who hold nativist
    preferences of political representation are more likely to be politically alienated
    and more likely to support Brexit.

  ABSTRACT: After decades in which party competition was fought in the centre ground,
    the 2017 UK General Election witnessed a return to more conflictual politics.
    In this article, we assess public support for the electoral strategies of the
    main parties and examine the extent to which the issues the parties campaigned
    on resonated with their own supporters, as well as with the wider public. Drawing
    on De Sio and Weber{\textquoteright}s (2014) issue yield framework, we show that
    the Conservative campaign – generally considered to be badly run – did not focus
    on issues that would fully exploit the opportunities for expanding support that
    were open to the party. Labour, by contrast, played a much better hand. While
    taking a clear left-wing stance on many policies that were popular with its constituency,
    the party also skilfully emphasized valence issues that Labour is often seen as
    more credible on, such as healthcare and education.

  ABSTRACT: Kerala has one of the most stable party systems in India, and represents
    a clear exception to the Indian norm of volatility, instability and electoral
    change. In this article, we explore the geographical structure of this stability,
    and examine the extent to which current political divisions are a reflection of
    the divisions that existed at the inception of mass democracy in Kerala more than
    50 years ago. First, we examine the extent to which historical legacies of party
    formation shape contemporary patterns of voting behaviour. Second, we examine
    the extent to which these historical legacies were established along social lines
    to do with caste, religion and class. Finally, we discuss the implications of
    these results.

  ABSTRACT: Inefficient and corrupt institutions provide an incentive for citizens
    to focus on short causal chains, which prize instant benefits from direct, clientelist
    exchanges over the promise of uncertain and distant programmatic rewards. Drawing
    on a tightly controlled comparison arising from the bifurcation of a state within
    the Indian federal system into two units that have demonstrated marked differences
    in institutional development post division, and a survey administered across the
    new state boundary, we show that citizens are more responsive to small inducements
    in weak institutional settings where the delivery of basic goods by the state
    is less certain, but that these institutional effects weaken as the size of the
    inducement increases.

  ABSTRACT: Why did Britain vote for Brexit? What was the relative importance of factors
    such as education, age, immigration and ethnic diversity? And to what extent did
    the pattern of public support for Brexit across the country match the pattern
    of public support in earlier years for eurosceptic parties, notably the UK Independence
    Party (UKIP)? In this article we draw on aggregate-level data to conduct an initial
    exploration of the 2016 referendum vote. First, we find that turnout was generally
    higher in more pro-Leave areas. Second, we find that public support for Leave
    closely mapped past support for UKIP. And third, we find that support for Leave
    was more polarised along education lines than support for UKIP ever was. The implication
    of this finding is that support for euroscepticism has both widened and narrowed—it
    is now more widespread across Britain but it is also more socially distinctive.

  ABSTRACT: This article presents an examination of class-based inequalities in turnout
    at British elections. These inequalities have substantially grown, and the class
    divide in participation has become greater than the class divide in vote choice
    between the two main parties. To account for class inequalities in turnout three
    main hypotheses – to do with policy indifference, policy alienation and social
    alienation – are tested. The results from the British context suggest that the
    social background of political representatives influences the ways in which voters
    participate in the political process, and that the decline in proportion of elected
    representatives from working-class backgrounds is strongly associated with the
    rise of working-class abstention.

  ABSTRACT: A growing body of work on candidate traits shows that people with a given
    social characteristic tend to prefer candidates or leaders who share that characteristic
    (Campbell and Cowley 2014; Cutler 2002). However, the existing evidence for whether
    women vote for women is mixed. For example, Kathleen Dolan found that candidate
    sex was a driver of voting behavior for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992,
    but not in 1994 or 1996 (Dolan 1998, 2001, 2004). Eric Smith and Richard Fox used
    pooled U.S. data from 1988 to 1992 and found that well-educated women were more
    inclined to support women candidates in House but not Senate races (Smith and
    Fox 2001), and others have found that women are more likely to vote for women
    candidates only when they are perceived as being pro-feminist (Plutzer and Zipp
    1996). By contrast Fulton (2014) found that women are not more likely to vote
    for women candidates in the United States, but that male Independents are somewhat
    less likely to vote for them. Others have found little evidence whatsoever of
    an association between candidate gender and vote choice (McElroy and Marsh 2010).

  ABSTRACT: Using constituency level data, the article examines the BJP{\textquoteright}s
    vote swing at the State and Constituency level in India. Drawing on theories of
    electoral realignment I examine the BJP{\textquoteright}s performance at the constituency
    level and investigate the extent to which the party drew voters from other parties
    (particularly Congress), mobilised new voters (via increased turnout), and appealed
    to the newly enfranchised (via increases in the size of the electoral roll). The
    results of the analysis show that the key to the BJP{\textquoteright}s success
    was its ability to mobilise new voters in places where it had previously not fared
    so well.

  ABSTRACT: Issues and controversies connected to problems of endogeneity plague many
    topics of interest in political science, perhaps none more so than in the field
    of economic voting where in recent years a lively debate has developed over the
    potential endogeneity of subjective economic evaluations to partisan preferences.
    Although a great deal of attention has focussed on dealing with these problems
    at the analysis stage rather less attention has been paid to dealing with the
    problem at source – that is at the measurement stage. In this study we use a question
    order experiment to assess whether partisan priming influences subjective evaluations
    of the economy. If it does then endogeneity bias might be reduced by making questions
    easier for people to comprehend and answer and by taking steps to minimize the
    need for information shortcuts.

  ABSTRACT: 'Does candidate religion influence vote choice? And if so, under what
    conditions does religion matter? In this contribution we provide the first systematic
    analysis of the impact of candidate religion on voting behavior in an ethnically
    divided democracy: Uttar Pradesh, North India. The results from a series of conditional
    logit models shows that Muslims are more likely to vote for Muslim candidates,
    but only when those candidates have a realistic chance of winning – there is thus
    a strong strategic element to their vote calculus. Moreover, there is no evidence
    that Hindus discriminate against Muslim candidates, or that parties face an electoral
    penalty for fielding a Muslim candidate.'

  ABSTRACT: This article explores the political foundations of ethnic security fears.
    We examine the relationship between the structure of party competition at the
    constituency level and security fears at the individual level in Uttar Pradesh,
    India{\textquoteright}s largest state. We show that security fears are higher
    in constituencies characterised by multi-party competition. The central implication
    of this finding is that rather than leading to ethnic moderation, multiparty competition
    in ethnic party systems tends to be more ethnically divisive than in two party
    systems, increasing collective fears of the future.

  ABSTRACT: Why does the strength of class voting vary over time? Recent research
    has emphasized factors to do with the structure of political choice at the party
    level. This article examines different aspects of this choice, and investigates
    whether voters are more likely to respond to the social cues or policy cues that
    parties send voters. The results from the British context suggest that the former
    are more important than the latter. The central implication of this finding is
    that social representation matters, and that the social background of political
    representatives influences the ways in which voters relate to political parties.

  ABSTRACT: In trying to explain why so many dalits failed to vote for the Bahujan
    Samaj Party, it is found that there are strong {"}performance effects{"} that
    determined voter choice in the 2012 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. In the
    eyes of many dalits, particularly the young and the well-off, the BSP did not
    perform well enough on key issues of governance. The strongest effects for performance
    issues related to corruption and development during the BSP'S rule.

  ABSTRACT: In this article we examine how much the public say they want choice in
    the provision of public services, and how far their perceptions of the amount
    of choice they feel they should and do have are related to satisfaction with public
    services. Our findings cast critical light on some of the claims made by both
    opponents and advocates of choice about the value the public place on choice.
    The claim of opponents that the public do not want choice is not supported. Citizens
    say they want choice and the more they say they want it the less satisfied they
    are with the service they receive. However, the claim that citizens value choice
    for its own sake is also not supported. Public perceptions of how much choice
    people have over which hospital they attend are not associated with higher satisfaction
    with NHS hospital services once we take into account perceptions of how much patients
    are involved in their treatment and their views respected. Satisfaction with hospital
    services is more likely to be delivered by ensuring that patents are fully appraised
    of their treatment options than by providing patients with choice between different
    service providers

  ABSTRACT: Parties make hundreds of campaign promises but not all are seen by voters
    as central to a party's offering. Studies of government promise fulfilment accept
    that not all promises are equivalent but in practice treat all promises equally
    because they lack an appropriate means of measuring promise centrality. To demonstrate
    the importance of accounting for pledge fulfilment, we develop a conjoint experiment
    method to measure public opinion about promise centrality which can be used to
    construct centrality weights. We demonstrate this approach{\textquoteright}s utility
    by examining the 2017 UK Conservative manifesto. Centrality weighting reduces
    our assessment of Conservative promise-keeping by 21 percentage points (1.3 standard
    deviations of typical promise completion rates found in comparative studies).
    Weighting increases the centrality of EU promises sevenfold, immigration promises
    sixfold, and reduces the centrality of miscellaneous administrative promises by
    more than half. These results illustrate that pledge centrality cannot be ignored
    when assessing pledge fulfillment.

  ABSTRACT: 'Electoral Shocks: The Volatile Voter in a Turbulent World offers a novel
    perspective on British elections, focusing on the role of electoral shocks in
    the context of increasing electoral volatility. It demonstrates and explains the
    long-term trend in volatility, how shocks have contributed to the level of electoral
    volatility, and also which parties have benefited from the ensuing volatility.
    It follows in the tradition of British Election Study books, providing a comprehensive
    account of specific election outcomes- the General Elections of 2015 and 2017-and
    a more general and novel approach to understanding electoral change.The authors
    examine five electoral shocks that affected the elections of 2015 and 2017: the
    rise in immigration after 2004, particularly from Eastern Europe; the Global Financial
    Crisis prior to 2010; the coalition government of the Conservatives and the Liberal
    Democrats between 2010 and 2015; the Scottish Independence Referendum in 2014;
    and the European Union Referendum in 2016.The focus on electoral shocks offers
    an overarching explanation for the volatility in British elections, alongside
    the long-term trends that have led to this point. It offers a way to understand
    the rise and fall of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), Labour''s disappointing
    2015 performance and its later unexpected gains, the collapse in support for the
    Liberal Democrats, the dramatic gains of the Scottish National Party (SNP) in
    2015, and the continuing period of tumultuous politics that has followed the EU
    referendum and the General Election of 2017. It provides a new way of understanding
    electoral choice in Britain, and also beyond, and a better understanding of the
    outcomes of recent elections.'

  ABSTRACT: 'Young people{\textquoteright}s lives and politics have been transformed
    by successive waves of crisis: the Great Recession, the Climate Emergency, and
    the Covid-19 Pandemic. This article shows how young people{\textquoteright}s lives
    in London are marked by {\textquoteleft}cycles of insecurity{\textquoteright}
    and a sense of powerlessness to effect change. The research nevertheless demonstrates
    how efforts to amplify youth voice have the potential to break these cycles and
    contribute to a more sustainable public policy.'

  ABSTRACT: 'Much attention has been paid by academics and policy-makers in recent
    decadesto declining levels of voter turnout and engagement with traditional political
    andsocial institutions in established democracies. These trends are particularly
    marked amongst young people. Drawing on data from the European Social Survey,
    this article examines the role of higher education (HE) both as a source of unequal
    participation and as a means of fostering civic and political engagement amongst
    young Europeans. It uncovers two significant new findings. First, that being in
    education matters more than an individual{\textquoteright}s level of educational
    attainment for levels of civic and political participation, and second, that HE
    establishments play a key role as social levellers: being in education neutralises
    differences between young people from high-income and low-income backgrounds with
    regards to such participation. The article argues that this places added emphasis
    on the role of educational institutions in nurturing democratic engagement.'

  ABSTRACT: 'Background: Young people have become disillusioned with mainstream electoral
    politics in established democracies, and are increasingly likely to engage in
    democracy on a case-by-case basis in issues that hold meaning for their everyday
    lives. These issues are most likely to be local and involve interconnected economic,
    social and environmental concerns.Results: The following study contributes to
    the understanding of the everyday politics of young people within a single urban
    environment (London) regarding sustainability-related issues. It departs from
    many previous studies of sustainability by employing a youth-centred approach,
    focussing on the authentic voices of young Londoners. The article shows how narrative
    structures can provide an effective way of understanding everyday politics and
    the interconnectedness of key issues through the words of these young people.Conclusions:
    The analysis identifies young people{\textquoteright}s relatively low prioritisation
    of most environmental issues – due to an overwhelming sense of economic precarity
    and a lack of opportunity to reflect upon the relevance of environmental issues
    for their everyday lives. The article emphasizes the importance of opening up
    spaces for deliberation and channels for youth engagement, to embed sustainability
    in global cities.'

  ABSTRACT: In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, we have witnessed a resurgence
    in nationalism, Euroscepticism and populist politics in Europe and the United
    States. Young people have borne the brunt of this crisis. Yet, in the 2016 UK
    referendum, the vast majority of younger citizens voted for Britain to remain
    in the European Union. But why did they do so? Drawing upon a bespoke survey of
    1,351 18 to 30 year olds, this article investigates the relative importance of
    socio-demographic factors, post-materialist values and primary self-identification.
    It finds that positive views about cultural diversity and being a full-time student
    were the greatest predictors of a young person voting Remain, whilst no significant
    association is found between higher educational attainment and voting Remain at
    the multivariate level. Setting the EU referendum within the broader context of
    youth politics, the article also identifies the existence of cosmopolitan values
    amongst young Remainers. This has major implications for both our understanding
    of the success of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party amongst young voters in the
    2017 general election, and the challenges the Conservative Party faces with regard
    to establishing support among Britain{\textquoteright}s young cosmopolitans for
    future elections.

  ABSTRACT: Young people have become increasingly disenchanted with electoral politics.
    This is particularly true in the United Kingdom, where the proportion of 18 to
    24 year olds voting in general elections fell from over 60 percent in 1992 to
    an average of 40 percent over the last four polls. On the other hand, we know
    that many young people are interested in {\textquoteleft}politics{\textquoteright}
    in a broader sense, and participate in democracy through a wide spectrum of political
    acts. However, few studies investigate the individual motivations and thresholds
    for youth participation. This article provides an ethnographic account of {\textquoteleft}#Votebecause{\textquoteright},
    an offline and online initiative to encourage undergraduate students to vote in
    the 2016 referendum on British membership of the European Union. The findings
    identify the importance of social networks, appropriate spaces for communication
    and deliberation, prior group membership, and internal efficacy for engaging young.
    people in the campaign.

  ABSTRACT: There is widespread concern about declining public involvement in established
    democracies. Europeans are turning away from mainstream electoral politics towards
    new forms of political engagement. This is particularly the case for younger citizens.
    If young people are {\textquoteleft}reinventing political activism{\textquoteright}
    (Pippa Norris), in which forms of participation and in which countries is it most
    true? Drawing on data from the European Social Survey, the following article compares
    and contrasts young people{\textquoteright}s politics in the fifteen old member
    states of the European Union. Youth engagement generally reflects a country{\textquoteright}s
    civic-political culture. But there are significant differences in levels of youth
    participation, in ratios of youth participation (compared to the adult population
    as a whole), and in the relative popularity of different forms of political action.
    The United Kingdom stands out, however, with a disturbingly large gap between
    the political engagement of young people and older adults.

  ABSTRACT: 'Public involvement in traditional political institutions has declined
    significantly over the past few decades, leading to what some have seen as a crisis
    in citizenship. This trend is most striking amongst young people, who have become
    increasingly alienated from mainstream electoral politics in Europe. Nevertheless,
    there is overwhelming evidence to show that younger citizens are not apathetic
    about {\textquoteleft}politics{\textquoteright} – they have their own views and
    engage in democracy in a wide variety of ways that seem relevant to their everyday
    lives. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, young Europeans have borne
    the brunt of austerity in public spending: from spiralling youth unemployment,
    to cuts in youth services, to increased university tuition fees. In this context,
    the rise and proliferation of youth protest in Europe is hardly surprising. Indeed,
    youth activism has become a major feature of the European political landscape:
    from mass demonstrations of the {\textquoteleft}outraged young{\textquoteright}
    against political corruption and youth unemployment, to the Occupy movement against
    the excesses of global capitalism, to the emergence of new political parties.
    This article examines the role that the new media has played in the development
    of these protest movements across the continent. It argues that {\textquoteleft}digitally
    networked action{\textquoteright} has enabled a {\textquoteleft}quickening{\textquoteright}
    of youth participation – an intensification of political participation amongst
    young, highly educated citizens in search of a mouthpiece for their {\textquoteleft}indignation{\textquoteright}.'

  ABSTRACT: Academics and policy-makers have highlighted the increasing disconnection
    between citizens and electoral politics in Europe. Declining citizen involvement
    in traditional forms of politics has manifested itself in lower voter turnout
    and a dramatic shrinkage in the membership of political parties. Citizens have
    turned to alternative forms of civic and political engagement. These trends are
    most marked amongst young people. Whilst a number of studies have examined the
    nature of political participation in Europe, and the participation of young people
    in individual countries or specific political activities (such as voting), hardly
    any research has looked at patterns of engagement {\textquoteleft}within{\textquoteright}
    a generation of young people across different democracies. The following article
    examines the political participation of young Europeans in national democracies
    in fifteen European Union member states. Previous studies have shown that citizens
    are increasingly moving away from electoral forms of participation towards alternative
    forms of engagement that are (for the population as a whole) much less socially
    equal. Using data from European Social Survey, this article finds that the social
    inequalities of participation are (with the major exception of voting) much less
    profound for young people. This latter finding has important implications for
    public efforts to promote greater youth participation in democracy.

  ABSTRACT: Declining youth participation in conventional forms of politics has become
    a central theme for academics and policy makers and has often been viewed as marking
    a crisis in citizenship. Yet there is overwhelming evidence to show that young
    people are not apathetic. They have their own views and engage in “politics” (more
    broadly understood) in a wide variety of ways that have relevance to their everyday
    lives. The following article compares and contrasts the civic and political engagement
    of young people both within and among the United States, Britain, and Germany.
    The core arguments are that the forms of engagement practiced by young people
    are heavily structured in favor of highly educated and well-off citizens and that
    young people as a group have increasingly been marginalized from electoral politics.
    However, the different experiences across the three countries give scholars a
    clearer idea of how these problems might be overcome.

  ABSTRACT: 'This chapter examines age differences in political participation in democratic
    societies by addressing a number of key questions. The first part of the chapter
    is dedicated to the question of when people start to develop political attitudes
    and behaviors and why the timing of these first-developed attitudes and behaviors
    is important. The second section of the chapter addresses whether early political
    experiences persist in later life (in other words whether political behavior is
    habitual) or whether these early experiences are over-written by newer experiences.
    The third section of the chapter focuses on what we know about aging and political
    behavior, and how the behavior of young people differs from that of older citizens.
    The final part of the explores the challenges and opportunities for research on
    aging: Which are the pivotal questions that are still unanswered? What new avenues
    of research merit attention?'

  ABSTRACT: The development of political engagement in early life is significant given
    its impact on political knowledge and participation. Analyses reveal a large influence
    of parents on their offspring{\textquoteright}s curiosity about politics during
    their teenage years. Increasingly, civic education is also considered an important
    influence on political interest and orientations of young people as schools are
    assigned a crucial role in creating and maintaining civic equality. We study the
    effects of civic education on political engagement, focusing especially on whether
    and how civic education can compensate for missing parental political socialization.
    We use data from the Belgian Political Panel Study (2006-2011) and the U.S. Youth-Parent
    Socialization Panel Study (1965-1997), which both contain information on political
    attitudes and behaviors of adolescents and young adults, those of their parents,
    and on the educational curriculum of the young respondents. Our findings suggest
    that civics training in schools indeed compensates for inequalities in family
    socialization with respect to political engagement. This conclusion holds for
    two very different countries (the U.S. and Belgium), at very different points
    in time (the 1960s and the 2000s), and for a varying length of observation (youth
    to old age and impressionable years only).

  ABSTRACT: Turnout among young adults has declined steadily in various advanced industrial
    democracies in recent decades. At the same time, as a consequence of delayed transitions
    to adulthood, many life-cycle events considered important for the development
    of electoral participation are experienced later in life. These combined trends
    call for a revaluation of the political life-cycle model and the way in which
    it explains voter turnout among young adults. More specifically, in this paper
    it is argued that variation in the timing of life events has been overlooked as
    an explanatory factor of generational differences in young adults{\textquoteright}
    propensity to turn out to vote. With accumulating evidence that the decision to
    vote is to some extent habitual, a lack of life experiences may cause young adults
    to form the habit to abstain rather than to vote. If the mechanisms of the life-cycle
    model are indeed correct, later maturation should at least partially explain why
    young adults these days are less inclined to vote than their parents or grandparents
    in their younger years. Based on the British Election Studies from 1964 to 2010,
    the findings of this study confirm generally observed patterns of a delayed assumption
    of adult roles by young citizens. This trend toward later maturation negatively
    affects turnout levels of young citizens. If maturation levels had remained at
    pre-war levels, the average turnout among Britain{\textquoteright}s post-seventies
    generation would have been no less than 12 percentage points higher.

  ABSTRACT: 'The question why people choose to vote or abstain in national elections
    has been extensively researched in past decades. Yet, disagreement over what drives
    citizens to the polls persists. Literally over a hundred different explanatory
    factors have been linked to the individual{\textquoteright}s decision to vote
    or abstain: ranging from individual characteristics like education, age and political
    interest, to socialization by friends and parents, to characteristics of the election
    like political competition, and many more. Slowly but surely it has become difficult
    to see the wood for the trees. In the research project that we describe in this
    chapter, we wanted to take a step back and summarize where we stand and what we
    know about turnout. To this end, we carried out a meta-analysis of 90 empirical
    studies of individual level voter turnout in national elections between 2000 and
    2010. This allowed us to identify which variables are consistently linked to turnout,
    and which are not. In this chapter we describe what meta-analysis is, and give
    an example of how to carry out meta-analysis by describing our research project
    on turnout.'

  ABSTRACT: 'Though the impact of deliberative polling on attitude change has received
    ample attention in the literature, micro models of attitude change before, during,
    and after deliberation are understudied. The relative strength of three competing
    views of the way attitudes change—the heuristics, systematic, and deliberative
    models—is assessed, using the quasi-experimental data of the EuroPolis deliberative
    project and comparing a group of people who participated in the deliberative poll
    with a control group. The results are: (1) in line with the systematic model,
    predispositions play a larger role than in the heuristics or deliberative models;
    (2) predispositions play a different role for participants and nonparticipants;
    (3) predispositions shape attitude formation in differ- ent ways depending on
    the issue at hand. On some issues the beliefs of participants change as a consequence
    of deliberation and become more complex and nuanced than before. This is, however,
    not the case for immigration issues where deliberation seems to strengthen predispositions.'

  ABSTRACT: Research suggests that the rightist discourse on immigration appeals to
    left-leaning citizens with lower levels of education. The opposite is, however,
    not true for right-wing voters with lower educational levels, and this asymmetry
    leaves left-wing parties at a disadvantage compared with the right on immigration
    and integration issues. Deliberative theory promises that discussion, information
    and reflection can promote a more balanced political discussion and a more enlightened
    citizen. This article assesses the extent to which deliberative polling increases
    the ideological awareness of citizens with lower educational levels. More specifically,
    it gauges the extent to which especially less well educated left-wing voters –
    those whose attitudes research finds to be particularly out of tune with their
    ideological predispositions regarding immigration and integration – adjust their
    attitudes as a consequence of deliberate exposure to informational input and the
    presentation of two-sided arguments. Use is made of unique data generated during
    the first European-wide deliberative polling project, {\textquoteleft}EuroPolis{\textquoteright},
    held in 2009. The results indicate that less well educated left-wing voters indeed
    have slightly more negative attitudes towards immigrants than leftist voters with
    secondary or post-secondary educational levels. Turning to the micro-mechanisms
    of attitude change in a deliberative setting, the analyses show that both levels
    of education and ideological predispositions play a role in the extent to which
    participants of the deliberative poll adjust their attitudes. In three out of
    four models, evidence is found that less well educated left-leaning citizens are
    indeed most likely to adjust their attitudes on immigration and integration after
    being presented with a more balanced discussion of the topic.

  ABSTRACT: This research departs from the observation in the literature that some
    countries, such as Canada, Great Britain and the United States, in recent years
    witness a widening of the gap in turnout between younger and older citizens. Based
    on election study data from ten countries this article shows that the trend toward
    a widening generational divide is not observed in all Western democracies and
    that over-time trends in the age gap as a matter of fact are decidedly varied.
    In an attempt to explain over-time patterns and between-country differences, this
    research focuses on changing societal characteristics and changes in characteristics
    of elections. More specifically, the idea that over-time variation in the transition
    to adulthood has been overlooked as an explanation of declining turnout levels
    among young voters takes a central place. The findings indicate that delayed transitions
    to adulthood lead to increased divergence in turnout levels between younger and
    older voters. Characteristics of elections, measured through indicators of electoral
    saliency, are not found to have a significant impact on trends in the age gap
    in voter turnout.

  ABSTRACT: Despite being among the most important indicators of political partici-
    pation, relatively little is known about the origins and the development of political
    interest over the lifespan. The formative years between childhood and adulthood
    are generally considered a crucial phase in which future electors form and strengthen
    political habits. The aim of this research is to better understand this important
    stage by examining the way in which parental socialization and life-cycle events
    affect the formation and growth of political interest during adolescence and young
    adult- hood. While parental influences are expected to take place during childhood
    and persist over-time, life-cycle events are considered to influence development
    in early adulthood for those adolescents who did not grow up in a highly politicized
    environment. We assess these assumptions by applying latent growth curve model-
    ing and using the German Socio-Economic Panel, which spans from 1984 to 2007.
    Our findings confirm strong parental socialization effects on interest levels
    during teenage years. While life-cycle events are not found to strongly affect
    the develop- ment of political interest during the formative years, the transition
    to adulthood is indeed a more critical period for those individuals who did not
    acquire high levels of interest from their family.

  ABSTRACT: Western democracies, with their increasingly diverse racial and ethnic
    popula- tions, are seeing more political candidates who are non-white. How do
    these non-white candidates fare at the ballot box? Does their non-white status
    mean they gain or lose votes? Do their challengers gain or lose votes? In recent
    work on the US case, it appears that candidate Obama lost votes in 2008 because
    of his non-white status. The research question we address here is whether, in
    the context of the 2010 UK parliamentary elections, the race or ethnicity of the
    can- didates played a role in the vote totals. What we find is that, while in
    some ways race does not matter, in other ways it does. In particular, it appears
    that the local incumbent party in a constituency typically gained at least two
    percentage points in vote share (of the major-three-party vote), when they had
    a Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic (BAME) challenger. Of course, this does not
    mean that BAME can- didates cannot win. It has been amply demonstrated that they
    can win. But what it does mean is that, other things being equal, the local party
    (which won the seat last time) is likely to benefit from their presence in the
    contest.

  ABSTRACT: Recent research from Canada, Great Britain, and the United States indicates
    that tur- nout in national elections is declining rapidly among young adults.
    As a consequence of this trend the age gap in voter turnout between younger and
    older voters widens. The aim of this paper is to understand whether similar patterns
    are observed in other Western democracies. Based on national election studies
    from eight European coun- tries, Canada, and the United States, turnout patterns
    of younger and older citizens are traced and compared over the past decades. In
    a second step, a first attempt at explai- ning aggregate patterns is made. More
    specifically, the hypothesis that young people are particularly sensitive to the
    level of competitiveness between different political par- ties is assessed. In
    low stake elections, turnout patterns of young citizens are expected to be relatively
    low. Therefore, declining turnout levels among young adults could be a sign of
    declining levels of political competitiveness. Nonetheless, multivariate analyses
    show that different measures of political competitiveness neither directly affect
    the age gap nor the turnout levels of young voters.

  ABSTRACT: Voter turnout has puzzled political scientists ever since Anthony Downs
    postulated the paradox of voting. Despite decades of research aiming to understand
    what drives citizens to the polls, the jury is still out on what the foundations
    of micro-level turnout are. This paper aims to provide a modest yet important
    contribution by taking a step back and summarizing where we stand and what we
    know. To this end, we review 90 empirical studies of individual level voter turnout
    in national elections published in ten top-journals during the past decade (2000–2010).
    Through a meta-analysis of the results reported in these studies, this paper identifies
    those factors that are consistently linked to individual level turnout.

  ABSTRACT: Voters that come of age at roughly the same time share common influences
    because of the specific political context during their formative years. We can
    therefore assume the errors in a model explaining their political behavior to
    be dependent. Recent advances in social statistical analysis of age-period-cohort
    (APC) effects propose the use of hierarchical modeling in combination with repeated
    cross-sectional survey design to solve this problem. We apply these random-intercept
    models to assess the impact of the political context on the development of generational
    turnout patterns, assuming that cohorts that grew up in a highly-politicized context
    have a higher propensity to turn out to vote despite of any age or period effects.

  ABSTRACT: Prosecuting anti-immigration party leaders for hate speech is theorized
    to yield electoral ramifications. We assess to what extent these trials are mediatized
    and whether news visibility of hate speech prosecution affects levels of anti-immigration
    party support. We compare four Western European countries (Belgium, France, Germany
    and the Netherlands) for which aggregate-level media and public opinion data are
    combined. We find that hate speech trials were highly mediatized, and dominated
    the headlines for protracted periods. This short-term news attention drives general
    news visibility for anti-immigration party actors. Thus, news about hate speech
    prosecution of anti-immigration politicians creates a reinforcing spiral of attention
    by increasing the general newsworthiness of a political actor. The findings seem
    to point to the cautious conclusion that hate speech prosecution is either directly
    or indirectly related to increased electoral support. While in France and Germany,
    general news visibility of anti-immigration party actors is associated with higher
    levels of electoral support, in the Netherlands and Belgium, news about hate speech
    prosecution has a weak and direct positive relationship with anti-immigration
    party support. This finding yields implications for political communication strategies
    of parties by suggesting that hate speech prosecution does not undermine the electoral
    performance of anti-immigration parties. In fact, initiating legal actions yields
    unintended effects by granting these parties a media platform.

  ABSTRACT: Party politics is about cooperation and conflict between political parties.
    At certain times, a party may rule out all political cooperation with a particular
    other party. In these cases, there is only conflict between the parties. This
    dissertation is about such situations. I define the systematic refusal of a particular
    party to cooperate politically with a particular other party as the party{\textquoteright}s
    ostracism of the other party. It is the causes and consequences of ostracism that
    I wish to explain in this thesis. In order to do so, I first define the concepts
    of the {\textquoteleft}anti-immigration party{\textquoteright} and the {\textquoteleft}communist
    party.{\textquoteright} Based on both a literature review and an expert survey,
    conducted in the course of this study, I classify other parties{\textquoteright}
    responses to the existence of 46 anti-immigration and communist parties in 15
    countries in postwar Western Europe as either {\textquoteleft}ostracism{\textquoteright}
    or {\textquoteleft}no ostracism.{\textquoteright} In the first part of this dissertation,
    I use the resulting classification as the dependent variable in a comparative-empirical
    analysis, in order to explain the variation in other parties{\textquoteright}
    political responses to particular political parties. Using logistic regression
    analysis on the basis of two different data sets, I find that other parties are
    likely to systematically boycott a far right party if they do not need to cooperate
    with it anyway. They are even more likely to do so if it holds anti-democratic
    ideologies. The {\textquoteleft}ostracism{\textquoteright} / {\textquoteleft}no
    ostracism{\textquoteright} classification is the main independent variable in
    the second part of the research, which aims at exploring the consequences of the
    exclusion of political parties for their electoral support. I argue and empirically
    demonstrate, by way of different regression analysis techniques on the basis of
    15 different data sets, that when ostracized, anti-immigration and communist parties
    are less able to affect policy outcomes, which is what generally interests voters.
    As a result, these parties lose votes. There is one main exception to this rule.
    Anti-immigration parties that operate in a political context where opposition
    influence in parliament is high, and which are represented in the national parliament,
    are immune to the deleterious impact of ostracism on their electoral support.
    It seems that these parties can exercise power over policy-making in spite of
    being ostracized, thereby remaining attractive to voters. Thus, institutional
    factors determine whether or not ostracizing a rival party is an effective tool
    in the hands of targeting parties in order to safeguard democracy - or just to
    hold on to power.

  ABSTRACT: This book studies how established political parties react to the far left
    and far right parties that have surged in many democracies worldwide. While some
    of the extremist parties are being imitated in response, established parties can
    also choose to systematically rule out all political cooperation with them, imposing
    a cordon sanitaire. A third response by established parties combines these two
    reactions. How common are these three responses, and how do they affect far left
    and far right parties{\textquoteright} electoral support? This book addresses
    these questions by analyzing experimental and non-experimental data from fifteen
    European countries since 1944. In doing so, it informs scientific and public debates
    about challenges to established parties, how these parties deal with these challenges,
    and what the consequences are for the quality of democracy in contemporary democratic
    societies.
